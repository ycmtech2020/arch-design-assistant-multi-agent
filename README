# AI Architecture Design Assistant

This application is a web-based AI system that generates and visualizes IT system architecture plans from high-level requirements using Azure OpenAI API and Graphviz, refined through iterative prompts. It combines a backend engine for architecture generation with a frontend UI for interacting with the assistant.

## Features
- Accepts user requirements via a simple web interface.
- Uses Language Models (Azure OpenAI) to generate architecture plans.
- Refines architecture iteratively with follow-up prompts.
- Visualizes architecture diagrams dynamically with Graphviz.
- Maintains conversation state for iterative design.

## Architecture Overview
The core components of this system are:

- **Frontend (`app.py`)**: Provides a web UI and API endpoints for requirements input and diagram display.
- **Backend (`architecture_agent.py`)**: Implements architecture plan generation and refinement logic leveraging Azure OpenAI and LangGraph.
- **Diagram Generator (`diagram_generator.py`)**: Converts architecture plans into Graphviz diagrams.
- **Configuration (`config.py`)**: Stores API keys, endpoints, and file paths.
- **Dependencies (`requirements.txt`)**: Lists required Python libraries like Flask, OpenAI, Graphviz, and HTTPX.

The workflow involves user input on the frontend, which triggers backend architecture generation that references previous designs for iterative refinement, producing a visual diagram for review.

## Setup Instructions
1. **pip install -r requirements.txt**:
2.  **Configure API Keys**:
- Update `config.py` with your Azure OpenAI resource endpoint (`AZUREOPENAIENDPOINT`) and API key (`AZUREOPENAIAPIKEY`).
- Adjust the templates path if necessary.
3. **Run the application**:
- python app.py
Access the app at `http://127.0.0.1:5000`.

## Usage
- Open the web interface.
- Enter your high-level system requirements.
- Submit to generate an architecture plan with a visual diagram.
- Use follow-up prompts for refinement.
